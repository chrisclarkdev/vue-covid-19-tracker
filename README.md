# vue-covid-tracker

# description 

This is a direct follow of Brad Traversy's Vue Covid Tracker app on Youtube, I've never used Vue and this didn't teach me much  about Vue but it did give me insight to using the Covid19 api, I have used this API before and it's interesting to see a good developer use it.
